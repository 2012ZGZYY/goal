\section step2-intro Introduction

The Step 2 program introduces the concept of the
\ref goal::Discretization and using the \ref goal::Output
interface to write visualization output to VTK
files that can be visualized with Paraview.

\section step2-using Using statements

First, several `using` statements are introduced
for convencience. The Teuchos objects `rcp`
and `RCP` are used to allocate and use smart-pointer
objects, and the Teuchos `ParameterList` object is used
to associate a string parameter name with an abstract
data container. These `using` statements are included
often throughout the \ref goal codebase.

\section step2-init Initialization and mesh loading

Next, the parallel services are initialized and
a simple square domain is meshed with simplical
elements, as in \ref Step1.

The `step2.cpp` main routine brings all of the
previously documented code together and executes
it as follows:
