\section step1_intro Introduction

The Step 1 program provides a very minimal introduction
to a few \ref goal and APF API functions. In this step,
the initialization and finalization of the parallel
services is covered, and a simple square mesh is
created and destroyed.

\section step1_main The main routine

In this section, the main routine of step1.cc is explained
line by line. For more information on a specific \ref goal
function, simply click on the function name.

First, the parallel services are initialized.

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 initialize

Next, a printf-style formatted message is printed,
explaining that this is the first goal step. The
\ref goal::print method only prints a message on process 0,
which will be useful later when parallel execution
is considered.

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 print

Next, a simple square mesh in the domain
\f$ [0,1] \times [0,1] \f$ is created with \f$ 20 \f$
elements in the \f$ x \f$ and \f$ y \f$ directions,
where the final boolean argument indicates that simplical
(triangles in this case) elements should be used.

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 create

Once the mesh has been created, a consistency check of
the underlying mesh data structure is performed.

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 verify

To finalize the program and clean up all allocated
memory, the mesh is destroyed

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 destroy

and the parallel services are finalized.

\snippet step1.cpp Step1 finalize

The full uncommented program is shown below.
