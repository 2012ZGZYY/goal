\section step2_intro Introduction

The Step 2 program introduces the concept of the
\ref goal::Discretization and using the \ref goal::Output
interface to write visualization output to VTK
files that can be visualized with Paraview.

\section step2_using Using statements

First, several `using` statements are introduced
for convencience. The Teuchos objects `rcp`
and `RCP` are used to allocate and use smart-pointer
objects, and the Teuchos `ParameterList` object is used
to associate a string parameter name with an abstract
data container. These `using` statements are included
often throughout the \ref goal codebase.

\section step2_init Initialization and mesh loading

Next, the parallel services are initialized and
a simple square domain is meshed with simplical
elements, as in \ref Step1.

\section step2_assoc Creating model associations

Next, we introduce an important concept of model associations.
For more information, see the \ref Disc page. These model
associations are stored in a `apf::StkModels` object.
Once this object is created, we create single model
`apf::StkModel` association for all of the elements in
the created square mesh. We call this association an
<em>element set</em>. We give this association the name
"square" and associate this name with the geometric
region uniquely specified by the dimension 2 and the
tag 0. Additionally, we create a single model association
for all of the nodes classified on the closure of all
geometric edges in the created mesh. We call this
association a <em>node set</em>. We give this association
the name "edges" and associate this name with the
geometric edges uniquely specified by the dimension 1
and the tags: 0,1,2, and 3.

\section step2_disc Creating the discretization

Using the newly created APF mesh and the model associations,
we create a \ref goal::Discretization object. This is done
by defining a `Teuchos::ParameterList` that specifies which
APF and model associations data to use. For more information
about the parameters for the Discretization object, view
the \ref goal::Discretization page.

\section step2_output Outputting data

Finally, we output the mesh to file. This is acheived
by creating a \ref goal::Output object and calling the
method \ref goal::Output::write.

\section step2_main The main routine

\snippet step2.cpp Step2 main

The `step2.cpp` main routine brings all of the
previously documented code together and executes
it as follows:
